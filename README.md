# Towards Fairness and Accuracy: A Comparative Study of Sovereign Credit Ratings by Global Agencies

## Abstract

This project examines the factors that influence sovereign credit ratings assigned by three prominent global credit rating agencies: Moody's, Fitch, and Standard & Poor's (S&P). We delve into the determinants of these ratings and their implications for countries, with a particular focus on the countries in the global south.

Our findings reveal a concerning negative bias toward countries categorized under the global south, indicating potential disparities in the rating assessment process. Additionally, we find that macroeconomic indicators such as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and external debt fail to demonstrate statistical significance in explaining variations in sovereign ratings. Furthermore, socio-political factors, including the Human Development Index and government efficiency score, exhibit similar insignificance in our analysis.

This project report investigates the transition probabilities of sovereign credit ratings using a Transition Probability Matrix (TPM) framework. The study utilizes historical sovereign credit rating data to construct a TPM, which quantifies the likelihood of transitions between different credit rating categories over specific time periods. It examines the concept of sticky ratings, wherein certain ratings exhibit persistence or resistance to change over time, influencing the overall dynamics of the credit rating landscape.

Through empirical analysis and statistical modeling, this research sheds light on the factors driving sovereign credit rating transitions and the persistence of sticky ratings. Such insights offer valuable implications for investors, policymakers, and financial institutions in managing credit risk exposure, designing investment strategies, and formulating sovereign debt policies.
